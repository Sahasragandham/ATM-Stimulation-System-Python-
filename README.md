## 🚀 Features

- ✅ 4-Digit PIN Authentication (3 attempts limit)
- ✅ Secure Login System
- ✅ Cash Withdrawal
- ✅ Cash Deposit
- ✅ Daily Withdrawal Limit (₹10,000)
- ✅ Balance Inquiry
- ✅ Mini Statement
- ✅ Transaction Counter
- ✅ Professional Console Output

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- Functions
- Basic Input Validation

## 📋 How It Works

1. User inserts card (simulated).
2. User enters 4-digit PIN.
3. Maximum 3 incorrect attempts allowed.
4. After successful login, user can:
   - Withdraw money
   - Deposit money
   - Check balance
   - Exit system
5. The system enforces:
   - Daily withdrawal limit
   - Positive amount validation
   - Sufficient balance check
